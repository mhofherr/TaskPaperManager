TaskPaperParser
===============

TaskPaperParser (TPP) is a little python script to parse and modify a TaskPaper file.
The script is right now based on my local environment and needs some adaption for different environment.
It provides the following features:

* Move done tasks (@done) to a separate archive file
* Check any repeat-tasks (@repeat) and instantiate a new task entry if a repeat-cycla comes up
* send daily status mails for @high, @medium, @duesoon and @overdue tasks
*
